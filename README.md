# Obsidian Portal A.G.E. Dynamic Sheet Template (DST)

This template is meant to be used for A.G.E. campaigns on [Obsidian Portal](https://www.obsidianportal.com/).

## Acknowledgements

This template is based on the work from [ChainsawXIV](https://github.com/ChainsawXIV), available on the [DST GitHub repository](https://github.com/ChainsawXIV/DST). Specifically it modifies the [DD4e Simple DST](https://github.com/ChainsawXIV/DST/tree/master/sheets/chainsawxiv_dd4e_simple) available in the same repository adapting it to the A.G.E. system.
